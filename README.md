# Four repositories used for ALICE analysis

## Efficiency
To compute the acceptance and efficiency factors

## Starlight
To compute photon fluxes and cross sections with Starlight model

## Rapgap

For studies on dissociative events, mainly to make sure that given the kinematics of an event no track should be produced in the acceptance of V0C

## SignalExtraction

Signal extraction in the JPsi mass region. In the subfolder GammaGammaStudy, it is signal extraction in the sidebands.
